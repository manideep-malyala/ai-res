| **Definition**       | The broad field that builds systems to perform tasks that require human-like intelligence. | A subset of AI that learns from data to make decisions or predictions. | A specialized form of ML that uses multi-layer neural networks to process complex data. | A subset of DL that creates new content (e.g., text, images, video) by learning patterns from existing data. | A branch of AI focused on autonomous planning and action—AI agents that can execute multi-step tasks with minimal human guidance. |
| **Goal**            | To mimic human intelligence. | To learn from data. | To model complex patterns. | To generate new content. | To act independently. |
| **Why It Is Required** | To automate tasks and enhance decision-making across various industries. | To uncover insights and personalize experiences by learning from historical data. | To tackle problems involving high-dimensional or unstructured data, where simple models fall short. | To boost creative workflows and streamline content production by automating content creation. | To manage complex, dynamic workflows and rapidly adapt to changing environments without constant human input. |
