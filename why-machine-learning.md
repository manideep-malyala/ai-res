|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **1. Fraud Detection in Banking** | Identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time to reduce financial loss and protect users. | Rule-based fraud detection struggles to keep up with evolving fraud techniques and new fraud patterns. | ML detects unusual transaction behaviors and flags anomalies using historical data patterns. | **Transaction Data:** <br> - Amount: $10,000 <br> - Location: New York <br> - Time: 2 AM <br> - Device: New Login <br> - User Behavior: Avg. $200 per transaction <br> - Merchant Category: High-Risk Merchant | **Fraud Alert:** "High-Risk Transaction Detected" <br> **Action:** Request additional authentication or block transaction | **Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Random Forests)** <br> **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1-Score (to reduce false positives) |
| **2. Self-Driving Cars** | Enable vehicles to autonomously navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make real-time driving decisions for safety. | Hard to define rules for all driving scenarios (e.g., pedestrians, sudden stops, unpredictable traffic). | ML processes sensor and camera data to recognize objects, predict motion, and make safe driving decisions. | **Sensor & Camera Data:** <br> - Object Detected: Pedestrian at 10m <br> - Speed: 40 km/h <br> - Traffic Light: Red <br> - Road Condition: Wet Surface <br> - Adjacent Vehicles: 2 at 5m distance | **Driving Decision:** "Apply Brakes Immediately" <br> **Action:** Car slows down and stops safely | **Deep Learning (CNNs for Vision, Reinforcement Learning for Control)** <br> **Metrics:** Mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU), Collision Rate, Latency |
| **3. Medical Diagnosis** | Assist doctors by predicting diseases based on patient symptoms, history, and medical scans for early and accurate diagnosis. | Rule-based diagnosis is limited to predefined symptoms and fails to adapt to new diseases. | ML predicts disease risks based on symptoms, test results, and patient history, improving accuracy and early detection. | **Patient Data:** <br> - Age: 45 years <br> - Symptoms: High fever, cough, fatigue <br> - Medical History: Hypertension <br> - Test Results: CT Scan shows lung opacity <br> - Biomarkers: Elevated CRP, WBC Count | **Diagnosis Prediction:** "Possible Pneumonia (85% probability)" <br> **Recommendation:** Suggest further tests or start treatment | **Logistic Regression, Random Forests, CNNs (for image analysis)** <br> **Metrics:** Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, AUC-ROC |
| **4. Product Recommendation** | Provide personalized product or content recommendations based on user behavior to increase engagement and sales. | Manually curating recommendations for millions of users is impractical and ineffective. | ML personalizes recommendations based on browsing history, past purchases, and user preferences. | **User Behavior Data:** <br> - Past Purchases: Wireless Earbuds, Phone Case <br> - Browsed Products: Smartwatch, Bluetooth Speaker <br> - User Ratings: Gave 5 stars to audio devices <br> - Session Duration: Avg. 10 min per visit | **Recommended Products:** "Smartwatch, Wireless Speaker" <br> **Reason:** Similar users bought these after purchasing earbuds | **Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** <br> **Metrics:** Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, Mean Average Precision (MAP) |
| **5. Cybersecurity Threat Detection** | Detect and prevent unauthorized access, phishing attacks, and network intrusions in real-time. | Traditional security systems rely on predefined rules and struggle to detect new cyber threats. | ML identifies unusual login behaviors and network activities to detect potential security breaches. | **Login & Network Activity:** <br> - User: JohnDoe123 <br> - Login Time: 3 AM (Unusual) <br> - Location: Russia (User is based in USA) <br> - Login Attempts: 5 Failed Attempts <br> - Network Traffic: 500MB data transfer in 1 min (Anomalous) | **Security Alert:** "Suspicious Login Attempt Detected" <br> **Action:** Block login and notify the user for verification | **Anomaly Detection (One-Class SVM, Isolation Forests, Autoencoders)** <br> **Metrics:** False Positive Rate (FPR), Detection Rate, Log-Loss |
