| **Problem Statement** | **Problem Definition** | **Challenges in Traditional Programming** | **How ML Solves It** | **Real-World Data (Input to Model)** | **ML-Powered Outcome (Predicted Output)** | **ML Model Type** |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| **1. Fraud Detection in Banking** | Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time to prevent financial loss. | Rule-based fraud detection fails against evolving fraud tactics. | ML detects anomalies in transaction behavior. | Amount: $10,000, Location: NY, Time: 2 AM, New Login, Past Avg: $200 | Fraud Alert: "High-Risk Transaction", Action: Block or verify | Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Random Forests) |
| **2. Self-Driving Cars** | Enable vehicles to make driving decisions in real-time. | Hard to define rules for all driving cases (e.g., pedestrians, sudden stops). | ML detects objects and predicts safe driving decisions. | Object: Pedestrian at 10m, Speed: 40 km/h, Light: Red, Road: Wet | Driving Decision: "Apply Brakes", Action: Car slows and stops | Deep Learning (CNNs, Reinforcement Learning) |
| **3. Medical Diagnosis** | Help doctors diagnose diseases using symptoms, history, and scans. | Rule-based systems cannot adapt to evolving diseases. | ML predicts diseases based on symptoms and test results. | Age: 45, Symptoms: Fever, Cough, Test: CT Scan (Lung Opacity) | Diagnosis: "Possible Pneumonia (85%)", Suggest further tests | Logistic Regression, CNNs (for medical imaging) |
| **4. Product Recommendation** | Provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior. | Manually curating recommendations for millions is impractical. | ML suggests products based on browsing and purchase history. | Past Purchases: Earbuds, Browsed: Smartwatch, Ratings: 5-star (audio) | Recommended: "Smartwatch, Wireless Speaker" | Collaborative Filtering, Deep Learning |
| **5. Cybersecurity Threat Detection** | Detect suspicious logins, phishing, and network intrusions. | Rule-based security can't detect new cyber threats. | ML finds unusual patterns in login/network activity. | User: JohnDoe123, Time: 3 AM, Location: Russia (User in USA), Failed Attempts: 5 | Alert: "Suspicious Login", Action: Block and notify user | Anomaly Detection (SVM, Isolation Forests, Autoencoders) |
