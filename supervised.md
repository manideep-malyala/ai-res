# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised Machine Learning teaches models using labeled data. Each input is paired with a known output, so the model learns to predict outcomes for new data. There are two main approaches: **Regression** (predicting continuous numbers) and **Classification** (assigning items to specific categories).

## Regression vs. Classification

| Feature                  | Regression                                                                 | Classification                                                            |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General Definition**   | Predicts a continuous value.                                               | Categorizes data into distinct groups.                                    |
| **In Machine Learning**  | Forecasts numerical outcomes (like prices or temperatures) by learning patterns from data. | Assigns inputs to specific classes (e.g., spam or not spam) by recognizing patterns. |
| **Goal**                 | Estimate a numeric value from the given inputs.                            | Decide which label or class an input belongs to.                          |
| **Input**                | Can be numerical or categorical variables (e.g., house size, weather metrics, financial indicators). | Features that distinguish between classes (e.g., text, images, behavioral data). |
| **Output**               | A continuous numerical value (e.g., $12.75, 25Â°C, 150.50).                   | A discrete label (e.g., "Fraudulent" vs. "Legitimate", "Spam" vs. "Not Spam").|
| **Popular Algorithms**   | Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regressor. | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification. |

## Real-World Use Cases

| Application   | Problem Statement                | Type           | Detailed Explanation (Inputs & Output)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Uber**      | **Predicting Ride Fares**        | Regression     | **Inputs:** Pickup & drop-off locations, trip distance, time of day, traffic conditions, and surge pricing factors. <br> **Output:** A continuous fare value (e.g., $12.75). <br> **Explanation:** The model uses historical ride data along with real-time factors to estimate a fare, ensuring riders are charged appropriately and drivers can plan routes efficiently. |
| **Netflix**   | **Predicting Movie Ratings**     | Regression     | **Inputs:** User viewing history, movie genres, cast and director details, and previous ratings. <br> **Output:** A continuous rating score (e.g., 4.3 out of 5). <br> **Explanation:** By analyzing a user's past ratings and preferences, the system predicts how much a user might like a movie, providing a numerical score that assists in personalized recommendations.          |
| **Amazon**    | **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews**| Classification | **Inputs:** Text from product reviews, including words, phrases, and emoticons. <br> **Output:** A discrete sentiment label: Positive, Neutral, or Negative. <br> **Explanation:** Using natural language processing, the system classifies each review based on sentiment, helping to quickly gauge customer satisfaction and identify product issues.                |
| **Tesla**     | **Predicting Remaining Battery Life** | Regression | **Inputs:** Driving patterns, road conditions, ambient temperature, battery age, and charging history. <br> **Output:** A continuous percentage value (e.g., 65% battery remaining). <br> **Explanation:** The model predicts the remaining battery life by analyzing various factors, allowing drivers to plan their trips and manage charging effectively.                     |
| **Facebook**  | **Detecting Hate Speech in Posts**| Classification | **Inputs:** Post content including text, images, and metadata (e.g., user context). <br> **Output:** A discrete label: "Hate Speech" or "Safe". <br> **Explanation:** The system uses advanced NLP and image recognition to analyze social media posts, classifying them accurately to help moderators manage harmful content and maintain community standards.           |
| **Healthcare**| **Diagnosing Disease**           | Classification | **Inputs:** Patient data such as symptoms, lab test results, imaging data, and medical history. <br> **Output:** A discrete label: "Disease Present" or "No Disease". <br> **Explanation:** By processing comprehensive patient information, the model helps in accurately diagnosing diseases, supporting doctors in making timely and informed treatment decisions.           |
