## Definition: Large Language Model (LLM)
A Large Language Model (LLM) can be conceptualized as a function that takes a word sequence as input and produces an output sequence. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

f: R^(n x 1) → R^(m x 1)

where n and m represent the length of the input and output sequences, respectively.

## Breaking It Down

1. **Function Representation**  
   - The LLM is represented as a function f.  
   - This function maps an **input word sequence** to an **output word sequence**.  

2. **Mathematical Notation**  
   - R^(n x 1) represents the **input space**:  
     - The input is a **vector** of size (n x 1), where n is the **number of tokens** (words or subwords) in the input sequence.  
   - R^(m x 1) represents the **output space**:  
     - The output is a **vector** of size (m x 1), where m is the **number of tokens** in the generated output sequence.  

3. **Intuitive Meaning**  
   - The model **takes an input sequence** (e.g., a sentence or a question).  
   - It **processes it** using deep learning techniques (such as transformers).  
   - It **outputs another sequence** (e.g., a continuation of the text or an answer to the question).  
   - The transformation from R^(n x 1) to R^(m x 1) shows that:  
     - The number of tokens in the output (m) **may be different** from the number of tokens in the input (n).  

4. **Example**  
   - **Input:** "What is the capital of France?" (7 tokens) → R^(7 x 1)  
   - **Output:** "The capital of France is Paris." (6 tokens) → R^(6 x 1)  

This representation captures how an LLM processes sequences mathematically and conceptually.
